# Exercise 16
# Write a function definition named identity that takes in any argument and returns that argument's value. Don't overthink this one!
def identity(arg):

  assert identity("fruits") == "fruits", "Ensure that the function is defined, named properly, and returns the correct value"
  assert identity("vegetables") == "vegetables", "Ensure that the function is defined, named properly, and returns the correct value"
  assert identity(1) == 1, "Ensure that the function is defined, named properly, and returns the correct value"
  assert identity(2) == 2, "Ensure that the function is defined, named properly, and returns the correct value"
  assert identity(-3) == -3, "Ensure that the function is defined, named properly, and returns the correct value"
  assert identity(-4) == -4, "Ensure that the function is defined, named properly, and returns the correct value"
