# Exercise 11
# Write a function definition for a function named add_one that takes in a number and returns that number plus one.
def add_one(number):
    return number + 1

assert add_one(3) == 3 + 1, "Ensure that the function is defined, named properly, and returns the correct value"
assert add_one(-5) == -5 + 1, "Ensure that the function is defined, named properly, and returns the correct value"
